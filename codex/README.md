Thoughts
- Despite network problems at beginning a lot of fun (i gotta get out of the countryside...)
- I need to be more patient and quiet in my mind - my speed improved exponentially but I could have been much faster on the first few despite the network by using the time the network didn't work to just think through the problem
- Codex is really incredible - next time we meet i'll beat you tho
